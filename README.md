Cat's App

This is my final project to pass final exam in CodersLab. It will be an app (SPA) about domestic cats. I will fetch data from a public API about cats: https://docs.thecatapi.com/. A user, could search info about each breed like behavior of cat, description, lifespan, normal weight, etc. User as well could look for photos of all breeds, and liked them. After logging he/she could upload own photos (cats photos only accepted) and delete them from server. The app will be codded in polish language, because is focused on Polish user. In future maybe English version will be provided. 

I will code it in React, with usage of React-Router, Hooks, Redux (in case if needed). I thinked about styled-components, but finally decided to separate styles from JS, and all styles I will keep in Sass.(It does not mean, that I will not add styled-components in the future).

This app will be developed with mobile first methodology and I will scale it in Sass using only media queries (for now I decided to not use libraries as react-responsive, or react-bootstrap, etc, I can always add it, in case they are needed).
Used technologies:
JS, React (with react-router and new Hooks, maybe Redux), Sass.

More info will be provided soon.
Project under developing currently.
